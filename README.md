# WORDLE HANGMAN
-------
Wordle hangman is based on the traditional pen and paper game. You can read more about it on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)).  I have also encorporated the concept of the hugely popular 5 letter word guess game, Wordle. Hence, every word that the player has to guess is 5 letters in length.<br/><br/>
The player enters their name. The player is then presented with a list of 6 word categories to choose from.<br/>The player chooses which category they wish to guess a word from.<br/>The word categories and their corresponding words are found in a google sheet (Wordle-Hangman).<br/>A word is picked by random from the players choosen category; this word is hidden from the player.<br/>
The player has 5 attempts to guess the word; one letter at a time.<br/> Like the traditional hangman game, each time the player guesses an incorrect letter an item is added to the graphical representation of the hanging gallows:
- 1 incorrect word - head.
- 2nd incorrect word - body.
- 3rd incorrect word - both arms.
- 4th incorrect word - both legs.
